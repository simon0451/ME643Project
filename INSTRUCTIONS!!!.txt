How to use git

Download the program git, then create and activate an account on www.github.com, next ask Simon for an invite to the project

Create a folder where you want to save your files
Go inside that folder and shift right click, open command window here
In the command window type in: git init
This initializes the folder you are in as a git repository

Next you need to add the "remote origin" - this is basically telling git where you want to download and upload (pull and push) your info from.
Type in: git remote add origin https://github.com/simon0451/ME643Project
This is the git repository we are all working on for this project, you can change the URL for different projects in the future

Type in: git pull https://github.com/simon0451/ME643Project
this will start a download of all the stuff that we already created. It can take a few minutes to complete.

You now have all the files, now try making an upload.
Download some kind of file, like a dank meme. Put it in the directory we have been working in.
type in: git status
You should see your file in red - any time you modify a file or add a new one it is not tracked. We want git to track changes.
Type in git add *
This adds all files that are not already added. You can also add a single file by typing in: git add somefile.txt

Type in: git status
Your files should be green only.

Next type in: git commit -m "put some information in the quotes about your commit"
This commits your changes on your local machine. Think of a commit as a save point, if you fuck things up you can come back to this point later.

Since we are working in a group we need to push all our commits to the online repository so everyone can see your updates and add their own.
Let's push the commit you made to the online repository.
Type in: git push -u origin master
You only need to do this the first time, you can just type in git push or git pull in the future (without the -u etc.)
Everyone else should have access to your data now, and they can use a "git pull" to get it.

Always type in "git pull" without the quotes before you begin working, it will sync you up with everyone else.
If you already made changes, do git pull then git push.

Useful commands <commands>:
<git clone [URL]> this downloads any code from github.com, depending on the URL
<git pull [URL]> this is the same as git clone, but you use this if you are actually working on the project and not just downloading the data
<git add *> this starts tracking changes on all files, you need to re-add files every time you change them
<git add filename.pdf> this adds a specific file/extension - this is rarely used
<git commit -m "useful information"> this creates a save point that you can go back to, and that teammembers can download. Put a description in the quotes
<git push> this uploads your save point
