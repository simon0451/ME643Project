%Equation solver - solves systems of non-linear equations

theta = 0; %angle of the AoA bar (radians)
AoA = 7; %mm, length of member 2
BoB = 20; %mm, length of member 5
BC = 100; %mm, length of member 4
AoBo = 45; %mm, length of member 1 (technically just the length between the two fixed points)
H = 102; %mm, height of system
omega = 1; %RPM, rotation of member 2 from motor
m = .45; %kg, mass of member 6
k = 175; %N/
